# Can-you-hear-the-shape-of-a-drum-
The source code for the numerical analysis of two isospectral domains in my bachelor thesis "Can you hear the shape of a drum?".

The file drums.nb is a mathematica notebook which calculates the first eigenvalues of two domains and graphs the first six eigenfunctions on the domains. It then also graphs the nodes of the 2nd and 4th/5th eigenfunctions which intersect on one domain but not the other. This was done using the built-in NDEigensystem function.

The file source_code.txt contains just the source code as a text format which makes it readable.
